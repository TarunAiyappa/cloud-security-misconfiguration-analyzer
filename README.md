# Cloud Security Misconfiguration Analyzer

A theoretical research study exploring the identification and mitigation of security misconfigurations in cloud-native environments. This paper introduces a framework grounded in DevSecOps practices, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scanning, policy-as-code enforcement, and artifact verification, contributing to the enhancement of secure cloud deployment strategies.

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This research presents a structured approach to understanding security misconfigurations in contemporary cloud-native systems. It highlights the key vulnerability vectors introduced through Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, and containerized deployment scripts, and proposes a layered analyzer incorporating tools such as Open Policy Agent (OPA), Trivy, and Sigstore to facilitate early detection and policy compliance enforcement.

The study also emphasizes the importance of left-shifted security integration in DevOps pipelines, focusing on automating configuration audits, reducing security debt, and aligning deployments with industry standards.
